# Are-Local-Governments-Financially-Resilient-to-Hurricane-shocks-

Here, I summarize my ph.d. job market paper.
In the study, I investigate the resiliency of local governmnet tax revenues in the United States.

**Motivation of the study**

This study started from the question, 
"Are the disaster preparation measures are effective enough to mitigate the potential damages of natural disaster?"

Let's think of earthquakes. Here in Oregon,  experts say the chances of a large quake in the next 50 years are between 15 and 20 percent (https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2018/03/when_the_big_one_hits_portland.html) and all buildings are required to pass the seismic evaluation. Although every individual households, firms, or governments have prepared, or will prepare for future disasters in different ways, no one can knows in advance whether the preparation for earthquake really helps mitigate distructive impacts of earthquake unitl there is an earthquake. 

**Data and study design**

I focus on the impact of hurricanes on the county governments' tax revenues to answer to this question for three reasons; 
- hurricanes are repetitive. In other words, it is predictable and it may induce mitigation efforts from economic entities.
- county governments provide core public services to residents using tax revenue,
- it has been known that hurricans have negative impact on local economy which would result in low tax collection after disasters. 

If hurricanes significantly affect the local economy, then it will also reduce public serivce provision because of reduced tax revenue. If this is true, the Federal, State, or County governments need to find a way to mitigate these potential fiscal impacts of hurricanes. 

**Model set up**

How can I empirically test whether hurricanes "affect / do not affect" county governments' tax revenue? 
Basic idea is to compare changes of tax revenues in county government before and after the hurricane events. If hurricanes affect local economy and if there is negative impact on tax revenue, the increases in tax revenue over time in hurricane affected counties (treated) will be less than the increases in tax revenue over time in counties without hurricanes (control). However, this simple comparison have some issues that need discussions. 

- Such comparison may only give me the effect of hurricanes on tax revenue; I cannot know whether hurricane impact is mitigated by any preventive or adaptive measures. 
- Moreover, there could be sample selection bias; hurricanes usually affect counties in South-eastern part of the U.S. continent. Also, the economic or social characteristics of in-land and coastl counties are different. Lastly, economic entities sort away to maximize their own objective functions (utility, profit, or others). 

So, I need some find some counties that are similar, or comparable; even the possbility of being hit by hurricanes. If I can successfully find comparable treated and control counties, and if only treated counties are affected hurricanes, then comparing the tax revenue changes over time in these two groups will give me the fiscal effect of hurricanes. However, I need one more; I need to indentify the effect of preparation on hurricane impact. To identify this effect, I will need some kind of prediction for hurricanes that will be a proxy for mitigation effort. 

I wrote the equation as below;

However, such simple comparision may not enough to capture the impact of hurricane


I found county-level tax revenue data from Census (https://www.census.gov/). One thing to note is, Census only opens data for years that end with 2 or 7 (so 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017 data are available).
My hypothesis is,
